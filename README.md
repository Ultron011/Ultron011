## 🧑‍💻 About Me  

A caffeine-driven third-year **B.Tech (Hons.) in Computer Science & Engineering (AI)** student — mastering the noble art of making computers smarter, faster, and occasionally more dramatic than humans.

I specialize in **accidentally breaking production** and then **heroically fixing it** (in a local branch, of course).

When I’m not wrestling with models or logic errors, I’m probably:  
- 💻 Solving competitive programming problems — because debugging the real world is harder than solving a 2-pointer problem.  
- 🤖 Building generative AI systems — because teaching a machine to do my work is my unofficial retirement plan.  
- ⚡ Surviving on 90% caffeine and 10% uncommitted Git changes.

### 🎓 What I’m Up To

- 🧩 Leading the **Competitive Programming Department** at [Programmer’s Paradise](#) (the official coding club of **CSVTU**)  
- 🧠 Building **Generative AI Agents** with LangChain, LangGraph & CrewAI  
- 💡 Exploring everything from **LLMs** to **AI reasoning systems**  
- 🧃 Learning faster than my caffeine wears off  

---

## 🧰 The Stack: My Digital Toolbox  

### 🧠 The Brain (Generative AI & AI Agents)
Caffeinated architect of intelligence — designing systems that argue, collaborate, and occasionally hallucinate for better results.  
**Languages & Tools:**  
`Python` • `CrewAI` • `LangChain` • `LangGraph` • `NLP` • `Machine Learning` • `Deep Learning` • `FastAPI`

### ⚡ The Adrenaline (Competitive Programming)
Weapon of choice: `C++`  
I breathe STL, dream in O(log n), and occasionally whisper sweet nothings to segmentation faults.

### 🎨 The Side Gig (Frontend)
When visuals are necessary: `React.js` + `Next.js`  
✨ Promise: No jQuery (well... almost).

## 🚀 The Mission: My Grand, Slightly Over-Engineered Goal  

I’m not just here to build AI —  
I’m here to build **the AI that builds the next AI.**  

Every project I touch is a step toward creating tools that **learn, reason, and maybe complain less than I do.**  
If there’s a new framework, I’ve probably already:  
- built a “Hello World”  
- found the edge cases  
- and filed a *slightly passive-aggressive* GitHub issue about it.

## 💭 Dream Goal  

> To contribute meaningfully to Artificial Intelligence —  
> or at least be the one who finally teaches an LLM to write a perfectly centered CSS button.

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate  

If you’re working on something that:
- makes machines a little smarter,  
- needs a competitive programmer who measures time in test cases, or  
- just wants to rant about CSS centering —  

👉 **Hit me up!**

## ⚙️ Current Status  

> 🧃 Running on caffeine  
> 💻 Experimenting with AI Agents  
> 🧩 Occasionally achieving a bug-free compile (once per lunar cycle)
